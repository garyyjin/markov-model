What is Computer Science? What is it that distinguishes it from the
separate subjects with which it is related?  What is the linking
thread which gathers these disparate branches into a single
discipline?  My answer to these questions is simple ---it is the art
of programming a computer.  It is the art of designing efficient and
elegant methods of getting a computer to solve problems, theoretical
or practical, small or large, simple or complex.
